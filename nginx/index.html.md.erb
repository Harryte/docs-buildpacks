## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This topic describes how to configure your NGINX application for use with the NGINX buildpack and how to push your NGINX app to Cloud Foundry.


### <a id='nginx'></a>NGINX Setup

We recommend using the [default NGINX directory structure](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nginx-buildpack/tree/master/fixtures/mainline) when setting up your NGINX.  This setup contains

* A root folder for all web assets
* A mime type configuration file
* A NGINX configuration file
* A yaml file that defines what version of NGINX you want to use

Any custom configuration changes you make should be made from these default files to ensure compatability with the buildpack

### <a id='custom_nginx_configuration'></a> Push Your App ###

Follow the steps below to push your application.

<table border='1' class='nice'>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>1.</td>
  <td>Use the <code>cf push APP_NAME</code> command to push your app. Replace <code>APP_NAME</code> with the name you want to give your application. For example:<br>
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push my-app 
Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username@example.com...
OK
â€¦
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1GB x 1 instances
urls: my-app.example.com
</pre>
   Or, if you do not have the buildpack, or the installed version is out-of-date, use the <code>-b</code> option to specify the buildpack as follows:<br>
<code>cf push APP_NAME -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nginx-buildpack.git</code>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>2.</td>
  <td>Find the URL of your app in the output from the push command and navigate to it to see your static app running.</td>
</tr>
</table>
