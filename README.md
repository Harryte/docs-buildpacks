# Writing Custom Buildpacks

This is a guide for developers about writing custom buildpacks to use with Cloud Foundry.
Buildpacks package the languages and libraries that support your apps.

The contents here are structured as a topic repository intended to be
compiled into a larger document with [Bookbinder](http://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bookbinder).

See the [docs-book-cloudfoundry](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-book-cloudfoundry)
repository for the complete list of open source documentation repositories, as well as information about the publishing process.

`docs-buildpacks` only uses the `master` branch to publish the Buildpacks documenation. The Buildpack documentation is not version specfic. If you need to add version specfic content, add a template variable in the book repo for that version.
