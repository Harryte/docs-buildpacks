## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This topic describes how to configure your .NET application for use with the
HWC buildpack and how to push your .NET application to Cloud Foundry.
HWC is a wrapper around [Hosted Web Core API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693832(v=vs.90).aspx)
for running .NET Applications on Windows.

### <a id='hwc'></a>HWC Setup

HWC relies on `Web.config` configuration for hosting the .NET Applications.

#### <a id='shadow-copy'></a> Shadow Copy Setting
[Shadow Copy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228159(v=vs.100).aspx)
is a hosting option that copies assemblies for an application in the `bin` directory
to the application's temporary files directory. This features is turned off and
unnecessary for applications runinng under Cloud Foundry. An app can override this
setting in application's `web.config`.


### <a id='push-your-app'></a> Push Your App ###

Follow the steps below to push your application.

  <td>1.</td>
  <td>Use the <code>cf push APP_NAME</code> command to push your app. Replace <code>APP_NAME</code> with the name you want to give your application. For example:<br>
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push my-app
Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username@example.com...
OK

requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1GB x 1 instances
urls: my-app.example.com
</pre>
   If you do not have the buildpack, or the installed version is out-of-date, use the <code>-b</code> option to specify the buildpack as follows:<br>
<code>cf push APP_NAME -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/hwc-buildpack.git</code>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>2.</td>
  <td>Find the URL of your app in the output from the push command and navigate to it to see your HWC app running.</td>
