This topic describes how developers can push an application with multiple buildpacks.

For more information about pushing applications to Cloud Foundry, see the [Deploy an Application](../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

##<a id='cfcli'></a> Specifying Buildpacks with the cf CLI

To push an application with multiple buildpacks using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), perform the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf v3-push YOUR-APP -b BUILDPACK-NAME-1 -b BUILDPACK-NAME-2
</pre>

To see a list of available buildpacks, run `cf buildpacks`.

For more information about using the cf CLI, see the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../cf-cli/index.html) topic.

##<a id='manifest'></a> Specifying Buildpacks with a Manifest

To specify multiple buildpacks using an application manifest, add the follow lines to the `manifest.yml` file:

```
buildpacks:
- BUILDPACK-NAME-1
- BUILDPACK-NAME-2
```

For more information about application manifests, see the [Deploying with Application Manifests](../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) topic.
